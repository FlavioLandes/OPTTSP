# OPTTSP
OPTTSP is a Java framework for the use and implementation of heuristics and metaheuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem (symmetric and asymmetric).
For use, it provides a set of implemented heuristics and meta-heuristics. Already for the implementation, it offers a whole structure to collaborate in this process.

# Implemented methods
Constructive heuristics: 
* Random; 
* Nearest Neighbor.

Local Search heuristics: 
* Random Descent Method.

Metaheuristics: 
* Iterated Local Search;
* GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure).

# Usage
The OPTTSP framework allows to use the heuristics and metaheuristics already implemented, as well as to implement new heuristics and metaheuristics.
For more details, please look at OPTTSP/src/main/java/example.
